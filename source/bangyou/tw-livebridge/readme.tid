; tw-livebridge

TW LiveBridge creates a real-time WebSocket link between TiddlyWiki and external tools like VS Code and R, enabling instant two-way communication. Edit a tiddler in your editor and preview it live in the browser, or click in TiddlyWiki to open the tiddler in your editor—no manual refresh required.

; Used in other tools

The bidirectional communication features of TW LiveBridge are leveraged by other projects to enhance their workflows:

* [[TiddlyEdit|https://github.com/byzheng/vscode-tiddlyedit/]] (VS Code extension) – allows seamless editing of tiddlers directly from VS Code.
* [[rtiddlywiki|https://github.com/byzheng/rtiddlywiki/]] (R package) – enables preview of R Markdown files inside TiddlyWiki.

These tools don’t use the plugin code directly; instead, they rely on the real-time communication channel established by TW LiveBridge.
